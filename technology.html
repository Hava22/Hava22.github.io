            <h2>Navigating the Digital Landscape</h2>
            <p>Technology is more than toolsâ€”it is a language, a framework, and an enabler of new forms of connection and knowledge. In our interconnected world, technology shapes how we learn, communicate, and build. It influences our values and choices, while also offering unprecedented possibilities for accessibility and innovation. From the structure of websites to the complexity of data pipelines, technology defines how we interact with information.</p>
            <p>My work with technology focuses on both building and analyzing digital systems. I use programming languages like Python and JavaScript, and frameworks such as Flask, to design tools that are both functional and socially meaningful. I believe in human-centered designâ€”creating interfaces that are not only efficient but also considerate of diverse user needs and experiences. The future of technology lies not just in faster computation, but in smarter, more empathetic applications of its power.</p>
