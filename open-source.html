            <h2>Open Knowledge, Shared Power</h2>
            <p>Open-source tools are more than free softwareâ€”they represent a philosophy of transparency, collaboration, and collective empowerment. The open-source movement breaks down barriers to entry by making technology and knowledge accessible to all. It challenges monopolies on innovation and gives everyoneâ€”from seasoned developers to curious beginnersâ€”the ability to contribute, learn, and build.</p>
            <p>In my projects, I rely on open-source platforms not only for practical functionality but also for the values they embody. Tools like Git, Linux, and Jupyter Notebooks enable scalable collaboration and reproducible research. They support a learning culture where code can be examined, modified, and improved by anyone. Open-source encourages a culture of peer-review and mutual growthâ€”essential qualities for ethical and inclusive tech development.</p>
